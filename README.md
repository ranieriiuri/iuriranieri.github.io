It's my website/portfolio project for Web development foundations matter.

In the beggining was a College project, but, i already want to develop something like it, just using html/css/js without frameworks!
It's still on tests, but i needed uploading it because my studies on 'web development foundations' required it was submitted even before all tweaks i have imagined.
It's still under construction...
